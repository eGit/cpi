#summary The CPI Online result URL Code

 = Overview =

 The CPI Online result data is encoded into a URL.  The software that performs this function is [http://code.google.com/p/cpi/source/browse/trunk/code/src/cpi/Code.java cpi.Code].

 = Code =

 The functions that handle the plain text string are the following.
{{{
        static String Encode(float nt, float nf, float st, float sf){
            return Hex.encode(Pad(Bits(nt,nf,st,sf)));
        }
        static float[] Decode(String string){
            return Bits(Pad(Hex.decode(string)));
        }
}}}

 The [http://www.google.com/search?q=One+Time+Pad Pad] function is a well known cipher, used with a known key to scramble the binary results data.
{{{
    private final static byte[] Pad = {
        'L', 'o', 'r', 'e', 'm', ' ', 'i', 'p', 's', 'u', 'm', ' ', 'd', 'o', 'l', 
        'o', 'r', ' ', 's', 'i', 't', ' ', 'a', 'm', 'e', 't', ',', ' ', 'c', 'o', 
    };

    static byte[] Pad(byte[] text){
        int len = text.length;
        byte[] re = new byte[len];
        for (int cc = 0; cc < len; cc++){

           re[cc] = (byte)(text[cc] ^ Pad[cc]);
        }
        return re;
    }
}}}

 The Bits function performs the 16 bit encoding and decoding of the quadrant values.  It does this using a fixed point representation for the values, known to exist between zero and one, and needing only a modest 1e-4 margin of error.

 = Plain text =

 The plain text embedded in this code is a binary 16 bit fixed point representation of the four CPI Quadrant values: NT, NF, ST, and SF.  

 = Eyeballs Privacy =

 We hope that most people will want to share their CPI Online results with others.  Sharing can be a powerful aid.

 But first we recognize our responsibility to provide a basic degree of privacy for any form of personal data, including the anonymous CPI Online result.

 As the result URL is intended to be saved, the URL itself does not reveal any personal data to a casual glance at it. 

 This is eyeballs privacy.  

 One must have a copy of the URL, and decode the URL, in order to have the CPI result data.
