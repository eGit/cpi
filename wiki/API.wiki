 The article [http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/articles/java_client_lib.html "Getting Started with the Google Data Java Client Library"] is a nice gentle introduction to GData services in Java.  While the CPI is not an AtomPub or GData style API, some of the basics are common.

= Groups integration =

 * Create [API_Group Group] by email with jdp@syntelos.com
 * Create [API_Project Project] by HTTP/OAuth API
 * For each member in project, deliver an [API_Inventory Inventory] URL
