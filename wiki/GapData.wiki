#summary The CPI Online as an example of Gap Data
#labels Featured

 The CPI Online [http://code.google.com/p/cpi/source/browse/trunk/server server] uses the [http://gap-data.googlecode.com/ Gap Data] software framework.

= Gap Data Bean =

 A bean represents the storage and caching and application I/O for a record in a relational database table.  It communicates with the Datastore and Memcache, and implements HTTP and XMPP applications with GAE.

 The Gap Data compiler generates java programming language source code for Google App Engine data beans.  The Gap Data Bean is defined in ODL.  

== Person ==

 The CPI Online redefines [http://code.google.com/p/cpi/source/browse/trunk/server/odl/oso/data/Person.odl Person] to implement the principal data table.  
{{{
package oso.data;
path /people;
import cpi.Inventory;

class Person version 5 {
    *unique String logonId;
    List.Primitive<Inventory> inventory;
    Float nf;
    Float nt;
    Float st;
    Float sf;
    Date created;
    Date completed;
}
}}}

 Gap Data employs this class for any logged- in user, so the CPI Online simply extends the definition of the named location of this class.
