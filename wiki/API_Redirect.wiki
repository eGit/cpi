 == HREF ==

 The link url accepts the following template variables

 || *Name* || *Value* ||
 || R_ST || Result (double 0.0 - 1.0) ||
 || R_NT || Result  ||
 || R_SF || Result  ||
 || R_NF || Result  ||
 || ID   || Profile identifier ||
 || ID_P ||  Project identifier ||

 == Target Frame Name ==

 A frame name will cause the redirect to target a browser window frame, or a new browser window (for any unknown name).

 == Sequence ==

 *inject* causes the inventory process to redirect before displaying a result page (with graph image).

 *timeout* causes the inventory process to proceed to the result page, and then timeout and redirect.

 == Timeout ==

 For sequence timeout, wait for this number of milliseconds before redirecting.
